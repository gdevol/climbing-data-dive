# Diving into Climbing Data

## Intro
The data used was pulled Feburary 2023 from mountainproject.com. While there are a number of resources, Mountain Project has a significant userbase. This information was pulled in an effort to better understand the climbing environment within the United States. 230,141 routes located within the 50 states, excluding US territories, were collected. The route information is user generated and relies on regional administrators to moderate, so it is heavily prone to error, inaccuracies, or ommissions. This data will need to be heavily cleaned prior to use.
